# Duckiebot Auto Parking system
## Intro
---
This project is a class project of **CSCI-4480/MANE-4480 Robotics I** @ RPI.\
Yuxin was the **team leader**, and was in charge of Computer Vision.

> Automatic parking is a feature of growing interest that has been implemented in an increasing number of vehicles. It has the potential to be very useful to many different people and if implemented properly could be beneficial in small ways like stopping superficial nicks and scratches to large ways like preventing major costly damage to the driverâ€™s vehicle and others.
>Our goal was to utilize the sensor provided with the [duckiebot](https://www.duckietown.org/) to obtain imagery of the surrounding area, process these images to locate a parking spot, and then implement a control system to navigate the duckiebot to the parking space and park on top of it. This report discusses our implementation and results.
