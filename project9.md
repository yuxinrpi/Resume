# Rhythm Game Robot

## Intro
---
This is my hobby project. A computere vision program was made to play the rhythm game on itself. The program captures the video flow from the game, and feed them into the computer vision algorithms. And shortly after, the program determines the best action, and controls the game.

## Demo
---
The video demo is shown below. The resolution is low at this time, I will update it later. Overall it is better than average human player, achieving an accuracy of >95%.
