# Sleep Aid Device
## Intro
---
This project is a class project of MANE-4330 Inventor Studio III taught @ RPI.
Sleep Aid Device (SAD) is a circadian rhythm monitoring and adjusting system that helps the user get prepared for sleeping. The system uses IoT technology to collect data and analyze it with Machine Learning on the cloud. Once the user is at the sleepiest moment, the system will suggest the user go to bed, and automatically turn off all electronic devices that may stimulate the user. Using such a device allows people to fix their sleeping schedule and be aware of how important good sleeping can help them to keep healthy.
