# Algal Bloom Removal Device
## Intro
---
This project is a class project of **MANE-4220 Inventor Studio II** @ RPI.\
Yuxin was the **team leader**, and was in charge of the CAD design.
> The presence of harmful algal blooms is gradually increasing, poisoning marine vertebrates as well as destroying their habitat. This greatly impacts species such as fish, seabirds, manatees, and shallow marine ecosystems.  Algal blooms are also toxic to humans through direct contact or even consumption of an infected animal. This greatly impacts areas in which economies heavily rely on fishing or ecotourism.

> To solve the algal bloom problem, the team proposed a solution by creating a motorized, solar powered, device that collects algae and packs them into chunks that could be used as bio-fuel.

## Solution
---
The device is a buoy that float on the ocean. Two motors below drive the device to the area where algal bloom happens, powered by the solar panels on the top of the buoy.\
The device has a agitator in the center, which will create a centrifugal flow in the water. Due to low pressure, the algae together with water will be sucked in from the bottom hole, and pushed on to the 5 filters on the surface.\
The algae stays in the device, and the water is pushed out. When the device is full of algae, it will return to the home port, where workers could recycle the algae collected.
